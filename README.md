# Empty Project Template

Inside your project you should have the following structure:
## At the top level:
### README.md
This file right here. Make sure you edit it to describe your project
### .gitignore
This file tells git which files to you should not track with version control
### Jar file(s)
Executable jar file(s) with all resources needed to run.

## src/ folder
This contains your source code, organized into one or more packages.

## doc/ folder
Includes all documentation other than this README

### Object design diagram

The object design document should be in PDF format.
First page/slide is object diagram, with description of objects on the next page(s).

On more complicated projects, you may need additional diagrams to
clearly describe subcomponents.

### Other documentation

If you found it useful to document your projects in other ways (class
diagrams, algorithm description, tables of events, etc.) put the
documents here.

## resources/ folder

This is an optional folder that you'll include if you are using any
resource files (sounds, images, etc.)

## .github/ folder
This folder may be automatically generated by the Github Classroom bot and updated when we change the autograder settings.
You should not change anything here, but you may need to pull the changes from the server before you will be able to push your own code.
